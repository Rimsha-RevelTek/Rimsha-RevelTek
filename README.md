## About Me:  :alien:
Welcome to my GitHib profile! I am a dreamer who believes in pursuing my passions and turning them into reality. With a graduation in English, I have always had a flair for language and communication, which has led me to excel in my previous role as an HR professional.

However, my true calling lies in the dynamic and exciting world of business, where I aspire to become an agile manager. With a keen eye for detail and the ability to adapt quickly to changing situations, I am confident in my ability to thrive in this challenging and rewarding field.

As a dedicated and driven individual, I am constantly seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge and develop my skills. I am excited to embark on this new journey and look forward to sharing my experiences and insights with the community on GitHub. </br>


I love learning new technologies and contributing to open source. Recently enjoying problem solving as well.

I am currently working on something cool. :shipit:  </br>
